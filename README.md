# Unsupervised learning of Particle Image Velocimetry

## Introduction
We present the first work using unsupervised learning approach for PIV problems. The proposed approachis inspired by classic optical flow method. Instead of using ground truth, we make use of photometric loss between two consecutive frames, consistency loss of bidirectional flow estimates and spatial smoothness loss among the estimates to construct the loss function. The approach shows great potential and advantages on fluid flow estimations. It outputs com-petitive results to classic as well as supervised learning methods on PIVdataset, and even outperforms them on some difficult flow metrics.
